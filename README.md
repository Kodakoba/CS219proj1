gonna add some stuff i guess

# how you use this shit shovelware
first you make sure you have packages **build-essential** and **gcc** (version 11.3 is included with ubuntu 22.04LTS, 13 would be ideal.)

next you build the project using make, and then run it with ./assembler.

the arguments for assembler are:

**assembler <file>** example **assembler listop.txt**

# want to contribute

> [!NOTE]
> Compatible now with TempleOS 
> Compatible with ANDROID-RISCV-BETA-0003
