# how you use this shit shovelware
first you make sure you have packages **build-essential** and **gcc** (version 11.3 is included with ubuntu 22.04LTS, 13 would be ideal.)

next you build the project using make, and then run it with ./assembler.

the arguments for assembler are:

**assembler <file>** example **assembler listop.txt**
